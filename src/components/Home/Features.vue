			<h2>Branding Begone!</h2>
			<p>
				Write your scripts without the hassle of featuring multiple product names all over them. RENC is an entirely
				<strong>vanilla</strong> API, functions are named to what they <strong>do</strong>, not to what brand they "belong" to.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="feature">
			<h2>Easier Scripting</h2>
			<p>
				Scripters writing scripts is no longer a daunting task, products which feature full RENC support will automatically work with their
				script.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="feature">
			<h2>Dedicated documentation</h2>
			<p>
				Indepth documentation for all functions are available through the GitHub Link. Featuring viable function aliases, full descriptions
				and complete examples for how functions should work.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="feature">
			<h2>Open to additions and edits!</h2>
			<p>
				RENC is an evergrowing API - edits, additions and criticisms are open and taken by anyone via our GitHub. It aims to provide a unified
				API after all!
